### **Lesson 2: Sentence Structure**  
EmojiLang uses **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)** order, like English.  

**Example**:  
👤🍴🍎 = "I eat an apple."  
*(Subject: 👤 | Verb: 🍴 | Object: 🍎)*  

**Add modifiers *after* the verb**:  
👤🍴⌛🍎 = "I ate an apple."  
*(Subject: 👤 | Verb: 🍴 | Tense: ⌛ | Object: 🍎)*  

**Practice**:  
Translate: "You (plural) will sleep."  
*(Answer: 👤👤💤🚀)*

### **Lesson 3: Plurals and Numbers**  
Use number emojis **before** nouns:  
- 2️⃣👤 = "Two people"  
- 5️⃣🍎 = "Five apples"  

**Example**:  
👥🍴3️⃣🍎 = "We eat three apples."  

**Practice**:  
Translate: "They ate 10 pizzas."  
*(Answer: 🎭🍴⌛🔟🍕)*

### **Lesson 4: Questions & Negation**  
- **Negation**: Add ❌ before the verb.
